WaveGAN on Custom Dataset

Overview
This repository contains an implementation of WaveGAN for generating audio samples based on a custom dataset. WaveGAN is a generative adversarial network designed to synthesize 1D waveform data, specifically for audio generation tasks such as sound generation or voice cloning.

This project trains WaveGAN using a custom dataset of audio files. The implementation is provided in a Jupyter Notebook format, allowing for easy experimentation and modification.

Features
WaveGAN architecture: A GAN framework designed for generating raw audio waveforms.
Custom dataset support: Allows training on your own dataset of .wav files.
Notebook-based workflow: The entire process from data preprocessing to audio generation is handled inside a Jupyter Notebook.
Model checkpoints: Save and resume training with checkpoints.
